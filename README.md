# Convex_hotels_project

Convex Optimization project : study of a dataset about hotel reservations and how they impact the probability of a client cancelling said reservation

The dataset we used for this project was found on Kaggle. Our goal was to provide an in-depth analysis about how certain parameters could potentially affect cancellation in hotel reservations. The code is stored in the notebook file. We used libraries such as LightGBM, Sklearn and imblearn (for the SMOTE technique). We also provided a report (written in french) detailing our process and how we approached the subject.

This project was realized alongside Mariam MAKSIMOUS and Doria DERAMCHI.
